## Description

Rag with Memory is a project that leverages Llama 2 7b chat assistant to perform RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) on uploaded documents. Additionally, it operates in a chat-based setting with short-term memory by summarizing all previous K conversations into a standalone conversation to build upon the memory.
Inspired from langchain - https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/#adding-memory

The database used is from the amazing Vlite repository which builds on numpy - https://github.com/sdan/vlite

The user interface (UI) provides the ability to change the current prompt and experiment with the most important text generation parameters. The little left corner of the UI keeps track of the tokens generated over the session.
